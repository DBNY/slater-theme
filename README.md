# SLATER
Slater than [Slate](https://github.com/Shopify/slate). Minimaler than minimal.

## Why
I think slate is awesome, but I don't like that it's a closed box, I love the flexibility of things like react-create-app because it let's you actually eject the project and extend it. So this is a bit of a hack but I think y'all enjoy it. If you don't like it though, you don't have to use it ;)

## Why why
Slate is a really big step forward to Shopify theme development. However, we generally prefer Webpack to Gulp, vanilla js to jQuery, CSS to SCSS, functional to object-oriented, etc. We've removed the boilerplate in favor of *nothing*, and will be releasing packages to replace the functionality of Slate in the near future.
