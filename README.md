SLATER
------

This is a fork of [Slate](https://github.com/Shopify/slate), for setup please follow that, I'll not be wasting any time on that here ;).

## Why
I think slate is awesome, but I don't like that it's a closed box, I love the flexibility of things like react-create-app because it let's you actually eject the project and extend it. So this is a bit of a hack but I think y'all enjoy it. If you don't like it though, you don't have to use it ;)
